# [Auto911 Application](https://share.streamlit.io/alihussainia/auto_911/main) 
In an average year, around 240 million 911 calls are made in the U.S. that averages out to over 600,000 calls per day only in United States. The reason of developing this solution is to utilize the power of AI to build an AI for Good Solution that can help people instantly anywhere in the world without paying a single penny! 

The solution is still in its infancy period and every contribution is welcome! I hope my efforts can serve the humanity and help people especially those in emergency situation.

Lastly, if you find this solution and/or the intention behind creating it worthy of appreciation, feel free to star this repository and reach out to me for any advice or suggestion on my [email](malirashid1994@gmail.com).
